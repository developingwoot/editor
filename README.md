# Sour Mash

A simple project using Electron, React, and Webpack

Clone then Run

`npm install`

If you do not already have the grunt-cli installed Run

`npm install -g grunt-cli`

You also will need to install electron if it is not already installed

`npm install -g electron`

Now you should be able to open two terminals in the first running

`grunt dev`

Once you are at the Waiting... text you can in the other window running

`npm run electron`

The app should then start up.
